# Open Policy Engine Backend

## Usage

To use this backend, specify `"opa"` as the `policy.backend` in the config:

```golang
import "github.com/veraison/services/config"

cfg := config.Config{
    "policy.backend": "opa",
}

agent, err := CreateAgent(cfg)
```

This is also the default backend, so if no other backend is specified, `opa`
will be used.

## Writing Policies

Please see the OPA [official
documentation](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/) for information on
how to write Rego policies. This section describes what is necessary to
implement a valid Veraison policy, and assumes a general familiarity with Rego.

### Package declaration

Your policy should specify `policy` as the package.

```rego
package policy
```

### Evaluation Data

Data to be evaluated is defined as the following variables in the `policy`
package:

`evidence` contains the JSON representation of `proto.EvidenceContext.Evidence`
structure. This is the scheme-specific values extracted from the attestation
token.

`endorsements` is an array of endorsement JSON objects. Their structure is
scheme-specific.

`result` is a JSON object representing `proto.AttestationResult` that was
generated by the scheme.

`scheme` is the name of the attestation scheme.


### Rules

You can update the attestation result by defining one or more of the following
rules:

- `status`
- `hw_authenticity`
- `sw_integrity`
- `sw_up_to_dateness`
- `config_integrity`
- `runtime_integrity`
- `certification_status`

The first overwrites the overall attestation result status. The subsequent rules
overwrite the corresponding entries in the trust vector.

The rules must be defined such that they produce the string `"SUCCESS"` if the
conditions have been met, and the string `"FAILURE"` otherwise.

As various versions are often represented using Semantic Versioning, `policy`
package provides a utility function, `semver_cmp` to aid in their comparison
(note: currently, pre-release suffixes are not supported).

For example:

```rego
sw_integrity = "SUCCESS" {
    # note: This is an example. The evidence entries do not correspond to any
    #       actual scheme.
    evidence["application-hash"] == "h0KPxSKAPTEGXnvOPPA/5HUJZjHl4Hu9eg/eYMTPJcc="
    evidence["firmware-hash"] == "h0KPxSKAPTEGXnvOPPA/5HUJZjHl4Hu9eg/eYMTPJcc="
    semver_cmp(evidence["firmware-version"], "1.2.0") >= 0
} else = "FAILURE"
```

#### Dealing With Multiple Attestation Schemes

If you expect your policy to be applied to inputs from multiple attestation
schemes, you differentiate between them using the `format` variable defined by
the `policy` package. For example you can define rules for each scheme, and
then alias the generic rules above to one of them based on the value of the
`format` variable. For example:

```rego
sw_up_to_dateness = psa_sw_up_to_dateness { format == "PSA_IOT" }
             else = enacttrust_sw_up_to_dateness { format == "TPM_ENACTTRUST" }

psa_sw_up_to_dateness = "SUCCESS" {
    # ...
} else = "FAILURE"

enacttrust_sw_up_to_dateness = "SUCCESS" {
    # ...
} else = "FAILURE"
```

### Example Policy

This is a example of a policy that sets the `SoftwareUpToDateness` value in the
trust vector for `PSA_IOT` and `TPM_ENACTTRUST` schemes (neither scheme has
built-in definition for software up-to-dateness, and so that entry is undefined
in the results generated by the schemes).

```rego
package policy

# Use the psa_sw_up_to_dateness rules iff the attestation format is PSA_IOT, and
# to enacttrust_sw_up_to_dateness iff the format is TPM_ENACTTRUST, otherwise,
# sw_up_to_dateness will remain undefined.
sw_up_to_dateness = psa_sw_up_to_dateness { format == "PSA_IOT" }
             else = enacttrust_sw_up_to_dateness { format == "TPM_ENACTTRUST" }

# This sets sw-up-to-dateness trust vector value to success iff BL version is
# 3.5 or greater, and to failure otherwise.
psa_sw_up_to_dateness = "SUCCESS" {
  # there exisists some i such that...
  some i
  # ...the i'th software component has type "BL", and...
  evidence["psa-software-components"][i]["measurement-type"] == "BL"

  # ...the version of this component is greater or equal to 3.5.
  # (semver_cmp is defined by the policy package. It returns 1 if the first
  # parameter is greater than the second, -1 if it is less than the second,
  # and 0 if they are equal.)
  semver_cmp(evidence["psa-software-components"][i].version, "3.5") >= 0
} else = "FAILURE" # unless the above condition is met, return "FAILURE"

# Unlike the PSA token, the EnactTrust token does not include information about
# multiple sofware componets and instead has a single "firmware" entry.
enacttrust_sw_up_to_dateness = "SUCCESS" {
  evidence["firmware"] >= 8
} else = "FAILURE"
```
