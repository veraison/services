## Configuration

`management-service` is expecting to find the following top-level entries in
configuration:

- `management`: management service configuration. See [below](#management-service-configuration).
- `po-store`: policy store configuration. See [kvstore config](/kvstore/README.md#Configuration).
- `po-agent` (optional): policy agent configuration. See [policy config](/policy/README.md#Configuration).
- `plugin`: plugin manager configuration. See [plugin config](/vts/pluginmanager/README.md#Configuration).
- `logging` (optional): Logging configuration. See [logging config](/vts/log/README.md#Configuration).
- `auth` (optional): API authentication and authorization mechanism
  configuration. If this is not specified, the `passthrough` backend will be
  used (i.e. no authentication will be performed). With other backends,
  authorization is based on `manager` role. See [auth
  config](/auth/README.md#Configuration).

### `management` configuration

- `listen-addr` (optional): the address, in the form `<host>:<port>` the
  management server will be listening on. If not specified, this defaults to
  `localhost:8088`.
- `protocol` (optional): the protocol that will be used. Must be either "http" or "https". Defaults to "https" if not specified.
- `cert`: path to the x509 certificate to be used. Must be specified if protocol is "https"
- `cert-key`: path to the key associated with the certificate specified in `cert`. Must be specified if protocol is "https"

### Config files

There are two config files in this directory:

- `config.yaml` is designed to be used when running `management-service`
  directly from this directory on the build host (i.e. outside docker).This is
  no longer supported (use the [native
  deployment](../../../deployments/native/README.md) instead). It is kept for
  illustrative purposes only.
- `config-docker.yaml` this is the file that is designed to be used when running
  inside the debug docker container. See [debugging docker
  deployment](/deployments/docker/README.md#Debugging). The `debug` command
  inside the debug container will automatically use it. If running the
  executable directly inside docker shell, rather than via the command, this
  file will need to be specified with `--config` option.

### Example

```yaml
management:
  listen-addr: 0.0.0.0:8088
  protocol: https
  cert: management.crt
  cert-key: management.key
po-store:
  backend: sql
  sql:
    driver: sqlite3
    datasource: po-store.sql
po-agent:
    backend: opa
plugin:
  backend: go-plugin
  go-plugin:
    folder: ../../plugins/bin/
```
