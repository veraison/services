# Attestation Walkthrough

This guide explains how to setup a verifier and an attester. To produce a
workable example setup, it is necessary to

- create attestation keys on the attester,
- provisioning trust anchors, reference values and endorsements on the
  verifier, and
- to create evidence on the attester for consumption by the verifier.

For this example setup evidence is provided in form of an PSA attestation
token.

## Dependencies

The dependencies required to run Veraison on your system depend on whether you are
using a native or Docker deployment. Please refer to the appropriate README
(see below) for details.

In addition, this walkthrough relies on the following:

- `go` compiler (even if using Docker) will be used to install additional tools
- `openssl` to generate keys
- `jq` is used for modifying JSON files (optional: you can use  text editor
  instead).
- `wget` to fetch the verifier key.

```sh
# on Ubuntu
sudo apt install golang-go openssl jq wget

# on Arch
sudo pacman -S go openssl jq wget
```

(note: some of these may already be installed on your system)

## Installing and running Veraison

You have two options for running Veraison on your local system: either
[natively](../deployments/native/README.md) or [via
Docker](../deployments/docker/README.md). Please refer to the linked READMEs for
detailed requirements and steps.

> [!NOTE]
> Commands in listings below will make use of the following locations (all of
> them will be set before they are first used):
> - `VERAISON_SRC`: the location of Veraison source
> - `VERAISON_ROOT`: the location of the Veraison native deployment (only if
>   using native deployment, not used for Docker deployment).
> - `WORK_DIR`: directory used for artifacts generated during this walkthrough.

If you have the prerequisites satisfied, you can create a deployment with

```sh
git clone https://github.com/veraison/services.git
export VERAISON_SRC=$PWD/services

# For Docker deployment
make -C $VERAISON_SRC docker-deploy

# Alternatively, for native deployment
make -C $VERAISON_SRC native-deploy
```

The rest of this document assumes that you have the `env.bash` (or `env.zsh`)
for the deployment sourced in your shell.

```sh
# For docker deployment (inside top-level source directory)
source $VERAISON_SRC/deployments/docker/env.bash

# For native deployment
export VERAISON_ROOT=~/veraison-deployment # default location
source $VERAISON_ROOT/env/env.bash

```

## Veraison

You can check the status of the deployment with

```sh
veraison status
```

If Veraison services are not running, then they need to be started with the
following command:

```sh
veraison start
```

To check the status of the database use the following command:

```sh
veraison check-stores
```

Of course, after the initial installation, the database will be empty. The
provisioning of reference values, trust anchors and endorsements will be
explained below and those will be stored in the database. If you haven't
created attestation keys yet, first look at the next section otherwise skip it.

In case of problems, use the following command (in a separate command line
window) to see the log output.

```sh
veraison follow <service-name>
```

Replace `<service-name>` with one of the services available with Veraison,
namely `vts`, `provisioning`, `verification`, `management`, or (for Docker
deployment) `keycloak`.

For Docker deployment, debug output can be enabled by changing the log level
inside `${VERAISON_SRC}/deployments/docker/src/config.yaml.template` before
creating the deployment (i.e. running `make docker-deploy`; if a deployment
already exists `make really-clean` should be done first). See also
https://github.com/veraison/services/tree/main/deployments/docker#debugging for
more detailed instructions on how to debug a specific service.

For native deployment, debug output can be enabled by changing the log level
inside `${VERAISON_ROOT}/config/sevices/config.yaml`. For this to take effect,
the services will need to be restarted, `veraison stop && veraison start`.

Sometimes it is necessary to remove the content of the database. In this case,
run the following command.

```sh
veraison clear-stores
```

To completely remove the deployment and remove the build artifacts use the
following command. Note that this requires you to re-run `make -C $VERAISON_SRC
docker-deploy` if you want to use Veraison again.

```sh
make -C $VERAISON_SRC really-clean
```

## Creating an Attestation Key for the Attester

Attesters need to have an attestation key to sign attestation Evidence. If this
key is not yet available, here are instructions for creating it. It is also
necessary to convert the keys into the JSON Web Key (JWK) format and a separate
tool is used for this transcoding.

To start, we create a private key in PEM format using the following command:

```sh
export WORK_DIR=$PWD/walkthrough
mkdir $WORK_DIR

openssl genpkey -algorithm ec -pkeyopt ec_paramgen_curve:prime256v1 \
    -out $WORK_DIR/key.pem
```

We use the `go-pem2jwk` tool to convert the PEM-encoded private key into a JWK.
First, we need to obtain the tool.

```sh
go install github.com/thomas-fossati/go-pem2jwk@latest

# add the location go installs into to PATH if it's not there already
export PATH=$(go env GOPATH)/bin:$PATH
```

The go-pem2jwk tool can convert a key in PEM format into a JWK using the
following command:

```sh
go-pem2jwk < $WORK_DIR/key.pem > $WORK_DIR/jwk.json
```

GitHub will complain if we show the PEM-encoded private key. Hence, we only
print the JWT containing the private key for this example. You are supposed to
create your private key for your example setup.

```json
{
  "crv": "P-256",
  "d": "-fVWtEiKGbVk1J92WRwCefa78RohjMUBVKRfKARMFSQ",
  "kty": "EC",
  "x": "Oq7AxYePubv1b3bhcszgwycyDKDBvIRL400LA4xoJWA",
  "y": "eXVOAz4k28xU4ylyQszt6CorQ7_EQdutFjDYSLRiUG4"
}
```

Next, we create a public key based on the private key using the following command:

```sh
openssl ec -in $WORK_DIR/key.pem -pubout -outform pem -out $WORK_DIR/cert.pub
```

The resulting public key in PEM format is:

```
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEOq7AxYePubv1b3bhcszgwycyDKDB
vIRL400LA4xoJWB5dU4DPiTbzFTjKXJCzO3oKitDv8RB260WMNhItGJQbg==
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```

We also convert the PEM-encoded public key to a JWK:

```
go-pem2jwk < $WORK_DIR/cert.pub > $WORK_DIR/pub.json
```

The result is shown below:

```json
{
  "crv": "P-256",
  "kty": "EC",
  "x": "Oq7AxYePubv1b3bhcszgwycyDKDBvIRL400LA4xoJWA",
  "y": "eXVOAz4k28xU4ylyQszt6CorQ7_EQdutFjDYSLRiUG4"
}
```

## Provisioning Trust Anchors, Reference Values and Endorsements

The Verifier must be provisioned with trust anchors, reference values, and
endorsements before it can be used. The `cocli` tool offers this functionality
and supports several subcommands:

- `comid` to create, display and validate Concise Module Identifiers (CoMIDs)
- `cots` to create, display and validate Concise TA Stores (CoTSs)
- `corim` to create, display, sign, and verify CoRIMs

See also the [detailed
documentation](https://github.com/veraison/corim/blob/main/cocli/README.md) in the
`github.com/veraison/corim` repository.

The `cocli` tool is part of Veraison deployment, and, provided you've sourced
`env.bash`/`env.zsh`, should be aliased in your shell with appropriate
configuration.

The concepts are described in separate IETF drafts, which are still work in
progress.

- CoTSs are explained in
  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-rats-concise-ta-stores/

- CoRIMs and CoMIDs are described in
  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-rats-corim/

The payloads are encoded in CBOR.

In the subsequent steps, we will create the CBOR-based payloads for submission
to Veraison using a RESTful API. Hence, we will have to create a CoMID for the
reference value and a CoTS for the trust anchor.

The command line tool, `cocli`, uses so-called templates as input to generate
the CBOR files. For completeness, the JSON files are shown below.

The first command creates a CoMID based on two input files, one for trust
anchors and another one for reference values. The
`$VERAISON_SRC/end-to-end/input/src/comid-psa-ta.json` file contains
information about the trust anchor(s) and the
`$VERAISON_SRC/end-to-end/input/src/comid-psa-refval.json` file contains the
reference value(s).

In our example, we need to provision the public key of the Attester to
Veraison. This allows Veraison to verify the digital signature covering the
Evidence (and the PSA attestation token in our case).

The Evidence, which we will create later in this walkthrough, contains the
hashes of the bootloader (BL), the PSA Root of Trust (PRoT) and the Application
Root of Trust (ARoT). The details of these software components are explained in
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-tschofenig-rats-psa-token/ The goal is
to provision the "reference" or "golden values" of these hashes to the
Verifier. This allows the Verifier to match the Evidence claims sent by the
Attester with the expected values.

```sh
jq --arg a "$(cat $WORK_DIR/cert.pub)" \
	'.triples["attester-verification-keys"][0]["verification-keys"][0].value = $a' \
	$VERAISON_SRC/end-to-end/input/src/comid-psa-ta.json \
	> $WORK_DIR/comid-psa-ta.json

cocli comid create \
    --template $WORK_DIR/comid-psa-ta.json \
    --template $VERAISON_SRC/end-to-end/input/src/comid-psa-refval.json \
    --output-dir $WORK_DIR
```

The public key, which we previously created, has to be copied into the
[`comid-psa-ta.json`](end-to-end/input/src/comid-psa-ta.json) file into the
`verification-keys` field. We do this using `jq` command above, but you can just
use your favorite text editor. The modified file is saved under
`$WORK_DIR/comid-pa-ta.json`.

Search for the `BEGIN PUBLIC KEY` section in the JSON file below. The UEID
field contains information about the specific instance of the device and serves
as a key identifier. Hence, this instance ID has to match the Instance ID claim
in the Evidence. The Implementation ID claim uniquely identifies the
implementation of the immutable PSA RoT. Veraison uses this claim to locate the
details of the PSA RoT implementation. The Implementation ID is also found in
the Evidence claims.

```

The reference values of the software contain the measurements for each
component. The semantics of the reference values are described in
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-fdb-rats-psa-endorsements-03 (see
Section 3.3), which is a measurement-map of a CoMID reference-triple-record.
Because of the relationship to the software component contained in the Evidence
consult also Section 4.4.1 of
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-tschofenig-rats-psa-token/.

Four fields are worth mentioning, namely

 - Label: The Label, which corresponds to the Measurement Type in the Evidence,
   is short string representing the role of this software component, such as
   "BL" or "PRoT".
 - Version: The Version is the issued software version in the form of a text
   string.
 - Signer-ID: The Signer ID is the hash of a signing authority public key for
   the software component. This can be used by a Verifier to ensure the
   components were signed by an expected trusted source.
 - digests: The Digests field, which corresponds to the Measurement Value in
   the Evidence, represents a hash of the invariant software component in
   memory at startup time.

          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Next, we combine the two previously generated files
(`$WORK_DIR/comid-psa-refval.cbor` and `$WORK_DIR/comid-psa-ta.cbor`) into a
CoRIM using the following command:

```sh
cocli corim create \
	--template $VERASON_SRC/end-to-end/input/src/corim-psa.json \
	--comid $WORK_DIR/comid-psa-refval.cbor \
	--comid $WORK_DIR/comid-psa-ta.cbor \
	--output $WORK_DIR/psa-corim.cbor
```

The content of the [`corim-psa.json`](end-to-end/input/src/corim-psa.json) file is
shown below. It indicates the attestation Evidence profile being used and other
meta-data.

```json
{
  "corim-id": "5c57e8f4-46cd-421b-91c9-08cf93e13cfc",
  "profile": "http://arm.com/psa/iot/1",
  "validity": {
    "not-before": "2021-12-31T00:00:00Z",
    "not-after": "2025-12-31T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

The CoRIM file can be submitted to Veraison using the following command:

```sh
     --corim-file $WORK_DIR/psa-corim.cbor \
     --media-type 'application/corim-unsigned+cbor; profile="http://arm.com/psa/iot/1"'
```

By dumping the Veraison database with the `veraison stores` command we can see
the correctly entered entries:

## Manually Creating Attestation Evidence

We use the `evcli` tool to create attestation Evidence. Note that only two
attestation formats are currently supported, namely the Arm PSA Token and Arm
CCA. The repository can be found here: https://github.com/veraison/evcli. In a
more realistic setup, we would be using either software that emulates an
Attester or, even better, a device that supports this functionality (like an
Arm v8-M development board).

The `evcli` tool is part of Veraison deployment, and, provided you've sourced
`env.bash`/`env.zsh`, should be aliased in your shell with appropriate
configuration.

Note that we will re-use the previously created JWT in this example.

The `evcli` tool's source repository contains documentation for the use of the
PSA attestation token format, which can be found at
https://github.com/veraison/evcli/blob/main/README-PSA.md

Two inputs are necessary to create the PSA attestation token, namely

- A set of claims, and
- A private key to sign the token.

We are using the following claims, in JSON format, encoded in the file
[`$VERASON_SRC/end-to-end/input/src/psa-evidence.json`](end-to-end/input/src/psa-evidence.json).
Note that the combination of the `psa-instance-id` and the
`psa-implementation-id` is used to identify the key. The `signer-id` contains
the hash of the public key used to sign the software/firmware. These concepts
are described in
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-tschofenig-rats-psa-token/

Note that the content of the evidence needs to correspond to the endorsements.
Omitting claims or software components will cause verification failures.

To create a PSA attestation token from the supplied claims and an attestation
key in JSON Web Key (JWK) format we use the following command. Follow the
instructions in the previous sub-section to create the attestation key.

```sh
evcli psa create \
    --claims $VERAISON_SRC/end-to-end/input/src/psa-evidence.json \
    --key $WORK_DIR/jwk.json \
    --token $WORK_DIR/my-token.cbor
```

The specification of the PSA attestation token can be found at
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-tschofenig-rats-psa-token, which
contains an explanation of the various claims and their semantics.

The command above will produce the PSA attestation token in CBOR format and
protect it using COSE_Sign1. The result is stored in `my-token.cbor`.

To verify the Evidence locally, the token and the public key need to be
provided to the following command:

```sh
evcli psa check --token $WORK_DIR/my-token.cbor --key $WORK_DIR/pub.json
```

If successful, it will return the list of claims:

```
>> "my-token.cbor" verified
>> embedded claims:

```

The `psa check` subcommand verifies the digital signature over the supplied PSA
attestation token and checks whether its claim set is well-formed.

To test it against the Verifier, the `psa verify-as` subcommand is used.

It has two modes, namely one where the tool acts as an Attester and another
mode where it acts as a Relying Party. The Relying Party mode uses the
previously generated PSA token as input while the Attester mode creates the PSA
attestation token on-the-fly.

Below, we use the Relying Party mode:

```sh
evcli psa verify-as relying-party --token $WORK_DIR/my-token.cbor | \
    tail -n 1 | tr -d \" > $WORK_DIR/ar.jwt
```

The response will be an Attestation Result encoded as a JWT, which is signed
with a JSON Web Signature (JWS).

For example, the following JWT is an example response returned by the Verifier.
It is a string consisting of three values separated by '.'. The first part is
the header containing the signing algorithm and other information. The second
part is the signed payload, and the last part is the digital signature itself.

```

The attestation result can be processed by a dedicated command line tool called
'arc'. The benefit of 'arc' is the proper decoding of the result. The
documentation of the 'arc' tool can be found at
https://github.com/veraison/ear/tree/main/arc

First, install the tool with the following command:

```sh
go install github.com/veraison/ear/arc@latest
```

To obtain the public key for verifying the attestation result fetch it from
.well-known using the following command:

```sh
wget --no-check-certificate -O- \
    https://localhost:8080/.well-known/veraison/verification | \
    jq '.["ear-verification-key"]' > $WORK_DIR/verif-pub.json
```

The result may be something like this:

```json
{
    "alg": "ES256",
    "crv": "P-256",
    "kty": "EC",
    "x": "usWxHK2PmfnHKwXPS54m0kTcGJ90UiglWiGahtagnv8",
    "y": "IBOL-C3BttVivg-lSreASjpkttcsz-1rb7btKLv8EX4"
}
```

Store the public key from the structure above in a separate file and verify the
attestation result using `arc` using the following command. We assume that the
attestation result is stored in `ar.txt`.

```sh
arc verify --pkey $WORK_DIR/verif-pub.json --verbose --alg ES256 $WORK_DIR/ar.jwt
```

The result is then shown as follows:

```
>> "ar.txt" signature successfully verified using "public_key.json"

Alternatively, it is also possible to display the attestation result using an
online tool, for example, https://jwt.io. There are also many command line
tools available to parse JWTs.

Once parsed, the header shows the digital signature algorithm that was used to
protect the claims of the JWT

```json

The claims contained in this Attestation Result are described in
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-fv-rats-ear/. The trustworthiness vector
shows the processing of the evaluation result. The overall appraisal status for
the attester is found in the `ear.status` field. The values for these claims
are re-used from another specification, namely from AR4SI (see
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-rats-ar4si/).

To use the Attester mode, use the following command assuming the private key is
available in JWK format and has been copied into the same directory where the
two input files are located.

```sh
evcli psa verify-as attester \
    --claims $VERAISON_SRC/end-to-end/input/psa-claims-profile-2-without-nonce.json \
    --key $WORK_DIR/jwk.json
```

The content of
`$VERASON_SRC/end-to-end/input/psa-claims-profile-2-without-nonce-without-nonce.json`
corresponds to the content of the previously used file
`$VERASON_SRC/end-to-end/input/src/psa-evidence.json` but with the nonce claim
omitted.

If successful, this protocol interaction will produce an attestation result as a JWT.
