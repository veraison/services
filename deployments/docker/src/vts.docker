# The stores should be modifiable by any member of group veraison (GID 616).
# This is to allow both the vts services' veraison user, and the manger's
# manager user to modify them. We can't simply match UID's of the users in the
# two containers because the manager has to UID-match the host's user. In order
# for a database to be modifiable, sqlite3 requires that not only the file is
# writable, but that the directory containing the file is also writable. When
# docker creates a mount point, the mode bits are set based on umask, and there
# does not appear to be a way to override that on case-by-case basis. To get
# around that, we need to create a subdirectory under the mount point, that we
# _can_ set mode bits on. Hence the stores are deployed into vts/ subdir inside
# the volume.
