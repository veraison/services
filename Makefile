Available targets:

	test:          run unit tests
	integ-test:    run integration tests
	lint:          run the Go linter against the source
	coverage:      run a check to make sure that unit test coverage is
	               above a pre-determined threshold ($(COVERAGE_THRESHOLD)%)
	clean:         clean up build artefacts
	really-clean:  clean up deployment and integration-test related artefacts
	docker-deploy: create and start the docker deployment (docker must be
	               installed, and the user must be in the docker group)
	bootstrap:     install required dependencies (only works on Arch, Ubuntu,
	               and MacOSX using homebrew)
	native-deploy: create and start the native deployment
	deb:           create .deb package for installation on Debian or Ubuntu

define __DOCKER_DEPLOY_MESSAGE

=============================================================================
Veraison has been deployed on the local system via Docker. If you're using
bash you can access to the frontend via the following command:

	source deployments/docker/env.bash

(there is an equivalent env.zsh for zsh). You can then view frontend help via

	veraison -h

In addition to the veraison frontend, env.bash will also set up aliases for
cocli, evcli, and polcli utilities.
